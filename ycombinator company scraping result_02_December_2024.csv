110,Village Labs,S24,"FINTECH, HUMAN-RESOURCES",NEW YORK,"At Village Labs, we help America's businesses become employee owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). 

ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. 

With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.

By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. 

Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned.",2023,"Roger Cawdette, Co-Founder & CEO I'm the co-founder & CEO at Village Labs where we're building software for ESOPs.

The founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren’t just great at selling—they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. 

However, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.

Mica’s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.

Every year, nearly 50% all truck space goes unused annually in the almost $1T US trucking industry. On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses. 

With trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.

Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they’re already on the road - and it’s great for the environment too. 🍃",2023,"Phillip Nadjafov, Founder Founder of Oway, an ML-based online rideshare platform that makes small-batch freight shipping affordable for everyone.
